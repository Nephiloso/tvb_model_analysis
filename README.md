# A Virtual Brain Model to examine the effects of critical brain dynamics of V1 cortex

### Overview
This is a repository of the internship project at Neuroscience department of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The title of the internship is "A Virtual Brain Model to examine the effects of critical brain dynamics on pre-stimulus phase and amplitude regulation". The aim of the project is to replicate the result of  [(Avramiea 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32324137/) on the platform of large-scale brain networks [The Virtual Brain](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_100682-1).
